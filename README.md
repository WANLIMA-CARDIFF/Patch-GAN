## üîç Overview

Clouds frequently obscure optical satellite imagery, limiting its utility in remote sensing tasks. We propose a novel **deep transfer learning** method leveraging a **Masked Autoencoder (MAE)** and a **Patch-based GAN** for accurate cloud removal.

- Utilizes **pre-trained MAE (ViT-large)** on ImageNet for robust reconstruction.
- Introduces a **patch-wise discriminator** to better assess local image realism.
- Achieves **state-of-the-art performance** on RICE1 and RICE2 datasets.

## üß† Method

### Generator
- Based on a Vision Transformer (ViT-large) encoder-decoder architecture.
- Initialized from a pre-trained MAE for image reconstruction.

### Discriminator
- Patch-wise classification (196 √ó 16√ó16 RGB patches) using a fully connected network.
- Each patch is evaluated as real/fake individually.

### Loss Functions
- **Reconstruction Loss**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Adversarial Loss**: Patch-level GAN loss

## üìÅ Dataset

We use the [RICE Dataset](https://github.com/BUPTLdy/RICE_DATASET):

- **RICE1**: 500 pairs of 512√ó512 cloudy and cloud-free images.
- **RICE2**: 736 triplets with cloudy, cloud-free, and mask images.
